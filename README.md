# Analysis_Whatsapp_Group
This will contain Python code of the tasks I had performed over my class WhatsApp group data extracted from .txt file backup. 

# What were the Ideas?
## 1. How the frequency of messages vary over the day?
it was mainly used to check which is the emptiest hour of the group.



# More ideas to implement
- [ ] who is the most emoji person in the group
- [ ] somewhat difficult but how did the mood of the group changed, can check with emoji
