# Analysis_Whatsapp_Group
This will contain code of some of the tasks I had performed over my class WhatsApp group data extracted from .txt file. 

Python was used as language, and the tasks are completed in Jupyter Notebook


# More ideas to implement
- [ ] who is the most emoji person in the group
- [ ] somewhat difficult but how did the mood of the group changed, can check with emoji
