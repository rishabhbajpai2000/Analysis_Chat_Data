# Analysis_Whatsapp_Group
This will contain Python code of the tasks I had performed over my class WhatsApp group data extracted from .txt file backup. 

# What were the Ideas?
## 1. How the frequency of messages vary over the day?

This can be used by someone if he/she wants to promote something in a group, then he can go on the busiest hour to get the most attention of the viewers. 

### 1.1 Who posted between 4 AM and 5 AM.
since 4 and 5 AM is the most silent time in my whatsapp group, still I wanted to see who were the masters of this time as well.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64163517/141661418-bf93463e-e978-4314-a431-6407285d00a4.png)

## 2. Who sends the most number of messages in the group?

## 3. Calculating the total time it took for the conversation?

Actually, it was just some personal thing, here I calculated the total amount of time with our usual typing speed it would have taken to do the chats. 

Here I have used whatsapp chat file backup and telegram chat backup file. 




# More ideas to implement
- [ ] who is the most emoji person in the group.  
    - [ ] calculate the number of emoji for each user of the group
    - [ ] then compare for who has highest score among them 
    - [ ] then declare the winner among them. 
- [ ] Evaluate the average mood of the group with the help of smillies used
    - [ ] give a sentiment value of zero to one to every emoji
    - [ ] evaluate the total sentiment score for the day, then devide it by the total number of emojis used on that day
    - [ ] plot a time varying graph of the same
